Reception[edit]
Some economists have responded positively to bitcoin while others have expressed skepticism. Francois R. Velde, Senior Economist at the Chicago Fed, described it as "an elegant solution to the problem of creating a digital currency".[126] Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong have found fault with bitcoin, questioning why it should act as a reasonably stable store of value or whether there is a floor on its value.[127] Economist John Quiggin has criticized bitcoin as "the final refutation of the efficient-market hypothesis".[65]
David Andolfatto, Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, stated that bitcoin is a threat to the establishment, which he argues is a good thing for the Federal Reserve System and other central banks, because it prompts these institutions to operate sound policies.[78]:33[128][129]
Free software movement activist Richard Stallman has criticized the lack of anonymity and called for reformed development.[130] PayPal President David A. Marcus calls bitcoin a "great place to put assets" but claims it will not be a currency until price volatility is reduced.[131] Bill Gates, in relation to the cost of moving money from place to place in an interview for Bloomberg L.P. stated: "Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be."[132]
In November 2013, three US government officials testified at senate hearings that "Bitcoin has legitimate uses". According to the Washington Post, "Most of the other witnesses echoed those sentiments."[133]
Acceptance by merchants[edit]
Most bitcoin transactions take place on a cryptocurrency exchange, rather than being used in transactions with merchants.[134] Delays processing payments through the blockchain of about ten minutes make bitcoin use very difficult in a retail setting. Prices are not usually quoted in units of bitcoin and many trades involve one, or sometimes two, conversions into conventional currencies.[135] Merchants that do accept bitcoin payments may use payment service providers to perform the conversions.[136]
In 2017 and 2018 bitcoin's acceptance among major online retailers included only three of the top 500 U.S. online merchants, down from five in 2016.[134] Reasons for this decline include high transaction fees due to bitcoin's scalability issues and long transaction times.[137]
Bloomberg reported that the largest 17 crypto merchant-processing services handled $69 million in June 2018, down from $411 million in September 2017. Bitcoin is "not actually usable" for retail transactions because of high costs and the inability to process chargebacks, according to Nicholas Weaver, a researcher quoted by Bloomberg. High price volatility and transaction fees make paying for small retail purchases with bitcoin impractical, according to economist Kim Grauer.[138]
Bitcoin started to be accepted also for real estate payments in late 2017. The first recorded sale of a house in exchange for bitcoin happened in September 2017, when Texas based Kuper Sotheby's International Realty brokered the deal using bitpay.com to process the payment.[139]
Two months later, a first recorded sale of apartment in the world and first real estate property in Europe was sold for bitcoin in November 2017 in the Czech republic. The Czech real estate agency HOME Hunters brokered a deal of a 3-room apartment for a Russian buyer without using a payment service providers at all.[140]
Some U.S. political candidates, including New York City Democratic Congressional candidate Jeff Kurzon have said they would accept campaign donations in bitcoin.[141]
Payment service providers[edit]
Merchants accepting bitcoin, such as Dish Network, use the services of bitcoin payment service providers such as BitPay or Coinbase. When a customer pays in bitcoin, the payment service provider accepts the bitcoin on behalf of the merchant, directly converts it, and sends the obtained amount to merchant's bank account, charging a fee of less than 1 percent for the service.[28]
Use in retail transactions[edit]
Due to the design of bitcoin, all retail figures are only estimates.[142][143] According to Tim Swanson, head of business development at a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency technology company, in 2014, daily retail purchases made with bitcoin were worth about $2.3 million.[143] MIT Technology review estimates that, as of February 2015, fewer than 5,000 bitcoins per day (worth roughly $1.2 million at the time) were being used for retail transactions, and concludes that in 2014 "it appears there has been very little if any increase in retail purchases using bitcoin."[142]
Financial institutions[edit]
Bitcoin companies have had difficulty opening traditional bank accounts because lenders have been leery of bitcoin's links to illicit activity.[144] According to Antonio Gallippi, a co-founder of BitPay, "banks are scared to deal with bitcoin companies, even if they really want to".[145] In 2014, the National Australia Bank closed accounts of businesses with ties to bitcoin,[146] and HSBC refused to serve a hedge fund with links to bitcoin.[147] Australian banks in general have been reported as closing down bank accounts of operators of businesses involving the currency;[148] this has become the subject of an investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.[148] Nonetheless, Australian banks have adopted the blockchain technology on which bitcoin is based.[149]
In September 2019 the Central Bank of Venezuela, at the request of PDVSA, ran tests to determine if bitcoin and Ethereum could be held in central bank's reserves. The request was motivated by oil company's goal to pay its suppliers.[150]
As an investment[edit]
Some Argentinians have bought bitcoins to protect their savings against high inflation or the possibility that governments could confiscate savings accounts.[151] During the 2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis, bitcoin purchases in Cyprus rose due to fears that savings accounts would be confiscated or taxed.[152]
Other methods of investment are bitcoin funds. The first regulated bitcoin fund was established in Jersey in July 2014 and approved by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.[153] Also, c. 2012 an attempt was made by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (who in April 2013 claimed they owned nearly 1% of all bitcoins in existence[154]) to establish a bitcoin ETF.[155] As of 10 March 2017 the bitcoin ETF was declined by the SEC because of regulatory concerns. The price fell 15% in a few minutes, but soon mostly recovered.[156] As of early 2015, they have announced plans to launch a New York-based bitcoin exchange named Gemini,[157] which has received approval to launch on 5 October 2015.[158] On 4 May 2015, Bitcoin Investment Trust started trading on the OTCQX market as GBTC.[159] Forbes started publishing arguments in favor of investing in December 2015.[160] In 2013 and 2014, the European Banking Authority[161] and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a United States self-regulatory organization,[162] warned that investing in bitcoins carries significant risks. Forbes named bitcoin the best investment of 2013.[163] In 2014, Bloomberg named bitcoin one of its worst investments of the year.[164] In 2015, bitcoin topped Bloomberg's currency tables.[165]
To improve access to price information and increase transparency, on 30 April 2014 Bloomberg LP announced plans to list prices from bitcoin companies Kraken and Coinbase on its 320,000 subscription financial data terminals.[44][166] In May 2015, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, announced a bitcoin index initially based on data from Coinbase transactions.[167]
According to Bloomberg, in 2013 there were about 250 bitcoin wallets with more than $1 million worth of bitcoins. The number of bitcoin millionaires is uncertain as people can have more than one wallet.[168]
Venture capital[edit]
Venture capitalists, such as Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, which invested US$3 million in BitPay, do not purchase bitcoins themselves, instead funding bitcoin infrastructure like companies that provide payment systems to merchants, exchanges, wallet services, etc.[169] In 2012, an incubator for bitcoin-focused start-ups was founded by Adam Draper, with financing help from his father, venture capitalist Tim Draper, one of the largest bitcoin holders after winning an auction of 30,000 bitcoins,[170] at the time called 'mystery buyer'.[171] The company's goal is to fund 100 bitcoin businesses within 2–3 years with $10,000 to $20,000 for a 6% stake.[170] Investors also invest in bitcoin mining.[172] According to a 2015 study by Paolo Tasca, bitcoin startups raised almost $1 billion in three years (Q1 2012 – Q1 2015).[173]
Crowdfunding[edit]
Bitcoin is useful for crowdfunding. For example, one college football sign netted over $20,000 in donations for a bitcoin enthusiast. He was shown by local TV company with a broadsheet "Hi mom, send bitcoins".[174]
Political economy[edit]
The decentralization of money offered by virtual currencies like bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the Austrian school of economics,[175] especially with Friedrich von Hayek in his book Denationalisation of Money: The Argument Refined, in which he advocates a complete free market in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks.[176]
