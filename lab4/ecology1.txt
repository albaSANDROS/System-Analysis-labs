The word “Ecology” comes from the Greek language and means “the study of the the place we live in”. So, there is no person on Earth who is not affected by ecological problems. For example, air polluted by plants will travel for a long distance with wind, the heavy particles will get into rivers and seas.

Pollution of the sea is the most dangerous. The regions that are most loaded with sea traffic are very dirty. For example, the Baltic sea is the dirtiest zone on the planet. The radioactive leak at Fukushima, Japan has led to the death of many fishes and other aquatic beings.

The cutout of forests, contamination of the seas and intense burning of coal has shifted the balance of the oxygen, ozone and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, making the ozone “shield” of the planet thinner. It results in global climate changes. Debates are still being held whether the “Global warming” is real, but every year there comes another evidence of the warming - the ice mounts melt at the poles, raising the global sea level.

You, of course, may say that you can’t affect the production of plants and factories much. But there is also the ecology of your home and your workplace. You shouldn’t pour dangerous chemicals to the ground - it will “die”, become infertile. Do not throw away batteries - send them to the recycling center. There are often special containers for batteries in major malls. Generally, do not waste resources - like take a shower, not a bath, turn down the water when you brush your teeth. Turn off electric devices that you do not use. Take care of the health of your environment.
