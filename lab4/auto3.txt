Automakers including Chrysler, BMW and General Motors are racing to make driving less distracting for those who want to text, e-mail and even check social media behind the wheel.

"Integrating certain apps into a vehicle limits eyes off the road and will remove the temptation to hold, look and manipulate the phone," says Tom Baloga, the recently retired engineering VP at BMW.

Among automakers' text/voice initiatives:

Several Chrysler models, including the Dodge Dart, can turn text to voice or allow drivers to read messages on dashboard screens. Drivers can respond with a few select responses, such as "I'm on my way," says spokesman Eric Mayne. Some vehicles with higher end radios, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Ram 1500 pickup, can send more "free form cloud-based text messages," Mayne says.


GM announced last month that 2013 Chevrolet Sonic and Spark vehicles with the Chevrolet MyLink communications system can translate voice to text and text to voice for drivers with compatible iPhones with iOS 6. The company also plans to add 4G LTE WiFi in some 2015 models but hasn't announced what commands will be voice-enabled.

When phones are paired with BMWs, drivers can get e-mail messages on dashboard screens that are limited to three lines. Text-to-speech will read the whole e-mail back. BMW's 7-series has a dictation function that turns speech into text that can be forwarded by e-mail or text.
