The word “Ecol­o­gy” comes from the Greek lan­guage and means “the study of the the place we live in”. So, there is no per­son on Earth who is not affect­ed by eco­log­i­cal prob­lems. For exam­ple, air pol­lut­ed by plants will trav­el for a long dis­tance with wind, the heavy par­ti­cles will get into rivers and seas.

Pol­lu­tion of the sea is the most dan­ger­ous. The regions that are most loaded with sea traf­fic are very dirty. For exam­ple, the Baltic sea is the dirt­i­est zone on the plan­et. The radioac­tive leak at Fukushi­ma, Japan has led to the death of many fish­es and oth­er aquat­ic beings.

The cutout of forests, con­t­a­m­i­na­tion of the seas and intense burn­ing of coal has shift­ed the bal­ance of the oxy­gen, ozone and car­bon diox­ide in the atmos­phere, mak­ing the ozone “shield” of the plan­et thin­ner. It results in glob­al cli­mate changes. Debates are still being held whether the “Glob­al warm­ing” is real, but every year there comes anoth­er evi­dence of the warm­ing — the ice mounts melt at the poles, rais­ing the glob­al sea level.

You, of course, may say that you can’t affect the pro­duc­tion of plants and fac­to­ries much. But there is also the ecol­o­gy of your home and your work­place. You shouldn’t pour dan­ger­ous chem­i­cals to the ground — it will “die”, become infer­tile. Do not throw away bat­ter­ies — send them to the recy­cling cen­ter. There are often spe­cial con­tain­ers for bat­ter­ies in major malls. Gen­er­al­ly, do not waste resources — like take a show­er, not a bath, turn down the water when you brush your teeth. Turn off elec­tric devices that you do not use. Take care of the health of your environment.
