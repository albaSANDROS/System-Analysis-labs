In times gone by, people had to go from one city to another for weeks and even months to get to the destination place, because they used horses, boats or their own feet to travel. Nowadays everything is changed and men cross the country or waters in some hours.

The most rapid mean of transport is travelling by plane. Other people prefer car, train or bus, because they are cheaper and it is possible to enjoy passing villages, forests and fields through windows.

Life in a big city makes people be depended on transport, especially if they live in the countryside.  Sometimes people have to change two or more transportation means (metro, suburban train, bus, share taxi, tramway, etc.) to get to a workplace or come back home after hard working day. The choice of the transport facilities depends on many factors: a financial ability, the distance between workplace and home place, time, comfort and other things. Most people prefer to get a car, because today it helps to be a little more independent from public transport.
