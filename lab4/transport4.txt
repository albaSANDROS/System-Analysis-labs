There is no doubt, that transport plays a significant role in our everyday life. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the majority of people have never dared to think and dream about traveling farther than a few miles. A great bulk of humans, wherever they would like to go, had to reach their destinations on horseback or by carriage. Nowadays, nobody is able to imagine our modern world without different means of transport. Hundreds and thousands of people travel every day either on business or simply for pleasure. These humans have a possibility to travel by air, rails, road or by sea. Unfortunately, if supplies of oil run out in the nearest future, it will be pretty much impossible to do.
So, what will transport be like then? In any case, this topic is utterly disputable though curious. To my mind, human beings will have to tackle this obstacle by using an electric engine, for instance, and by implementing sophisticated technology, which is based on alternative energy sources. It includes wind, ocean, solar, geothermal and bio energy. It gives an opportunity to evolve compact vehicles that don't damage the ecology of the planet. Anyway, there is no point to use vestiges of the past and rely on that old transportation forms, because they don't meet the requirements of humanity in general.
Frankly speaking, in conclusion, I could admit, there is probably no clear–cut answer to this question, 'cause there is a variety of choices and options. Nonetheless, everyone could agree, those future ways of transportation depend on many factors like government, the welfare of one particular nation, development level etc. So many men, so many minds. Our future is a great mystery and nobody knows what will be tomorrow.
